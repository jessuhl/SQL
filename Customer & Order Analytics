WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID 
WHERE length(Feb.orderID) = 6
AND Feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust

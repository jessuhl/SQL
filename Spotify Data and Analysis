# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table.
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,

energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,

acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL);

#Then I inserted the the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#I determinded the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT

#Then I discovered which artist released the longest track.

#Next, I used a CTE to tag artists with an average popularity score of at least 90 as being a 'Top Star'.
